## Risks/Mitigations

*   **Risk:** Data quality issues may impact model performance.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust data validation and cleaning procedures.
*   **Risk:** Model complexity may lead to overfitting.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use regularization techniques and cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
*   **Risk:** Integration of reinforcement learning may be challenging.
    *   **Mitigation:** Start with a simple reinforcement learning algorithm and gradually increase complexity.
*   **Risk:** Dashboard development may be time-consuming.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use a pre-built dashboard framework and focus on key visualizations.
*   **Risk:** The 10-file limit may slow down development.
    *   **Mitigation:** Carefully plan each segment to maximize efficiency and minimize the number of files required.
*   **Risk:** Unexpected dependencies between components may arise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Maintain a detailed project state log and communicate regularly to identify and resolve dependencies.
