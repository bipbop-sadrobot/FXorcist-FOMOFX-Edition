# Discovered Large Historical Forex Datasets

Based on searches for historical forex data on GitHub and similar sites (using web_search with site:github.com and related queries), here are relevant large datasets or tools for downloading them. I prioritized free, CSV-based, high-quality sources with tick/1-min/daily data, focusing on forex pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD. These are real-world datasets (not generated), often from brokers like Dukascopy or HistData. I selected the top 5 from results, with download instructions and why they're useful. All are public repos; no private access needed.

## ejtraderLabs/historical-data (GitHub Repo):

Description: Contains historical forex CSV data for over 66 pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, USD/JPY). Timeframes: M15, M30, H1, H4, D1. Length: 10+ years (up to current). Total size: Large (~GBs when uncompressed). Includes commodities via FX crosses.
Why Relevant: Direct CSVs ready for ingestion; no need for APIs. Suitable for backtesting forex models.
Download: Clone repo git clone https://github.com/ejtraderLabs/historical-data.git. Files in subdirs by pair/timeframe (e.g., EURUSD/M15.csv).
License: Open-source (MIT); free for use.

## philipperemy/FX-1-Minute-Data (GitHub Repo):

Description: Dataset of 1-minute FX prices from 2000 to present, in Generic ASCII/CSV format. Covers 66+ FX pairs, plus commodities (e.g., GOLD/USD) and indexes. Total: Millions of rows, ~10-20 GB uncompressed.
Why Relevant: High-resolution (1-min bars) for intraday analysis; includes bid/ask/volume. Ideal for tick-like data without full ticks.
Download: Clone git clone https://github.com/philipperemy/FX-1-Minute-Data.git. Data in ZIP/CSV files by year/pair.
License: Public domain; free.

## Leo4815162342/dukascopy-node (GitHub Repo/Tool):

Description: Node.js tool to download Dukascopy historical tick data (bi5 format, convertible to CSV). Covers forex, stocks, crypto, commodities. Tick-level (sub-second), large datasets (e.g., EUR/USD ticks for 10 years ~100 GB).
Why Relevant: True tick data for precise forex simulation; script converts to CSV. Dukascopy is a reliable Swiss broker source.
Download: Clone git clone https://github.com/Leo4815162342/dukascopy-node.git, install (npm i), run dukascopy-node -i eurusd -from 2025-01-01 -to 2025-08-17 -t ticks -f csv. Outputs CSV.
License: MIT; data free from Dukascopy.

## algogenetic/dukascopy-1 (GitHub Repo/Tool):

Description: Web tool/downloader for Dukascopy tick data in CSV. Supports forex/CFD/commodities. Multi-threaded for fast downloads; large sets (e.g., full history for major pairs).
Why Relevant: Easy CSV export of tick data; handles large volumes with threading.
Download: Clone git clone https://github.com/algogenetic/dukascopy-1.git, run script to fetch and save as CSV.
License: Open-source; data free.

## Other Notable (from HistData integration on GitHub mentions):

Though not a direct repo, many point to HistData.com datasets (free ASCII CSV for 1-min/tick forex data, 20+ years, 40+ pairs). Repo example: https://github.com/philipperemy/FX-1-Minute-Data links to it. Download from https://www.histdata.com/download-free-forex-historical-data/?/ascii/1-minute-bar-quotes/eurusd/2025 (ZIP CSV, ~MBs per year).
Why Relevant: Clean, large historical bars/ticks; used in many GitHub forex ML repos.

These can be ingested directly into data/raw/ for Stage 1.1. Total potential size: 10-100 GB for full historyâ€”batch process to respect limits. If needed, I can browse specific repos for more details.

# Enhanced Libraries and Dependencies (For Robust Logic)

To make the code more robust for production (e.g., handling API failures, large data, parallelism), here are enhanced suggestions. Since the environment can't install new packages, I stick to pre-installed ones (numpy, pandas, torch, statsmodels, etc.). For unavailable (e.g., tenacity), I implement equivalents manually. Focus on forex-specific robustness: Retry logic for APIs, parallel processing for large CSVs, memory-efficient streaming with pandas chunks.

## Core Enhancements:

*   requests: Already used; add session for persistent connections to reduce API latency.
*   pandas: Use for ingestion; enhance with chunked reading (pd.read_csv(chunksize=100000)) for large datasets (>10M rows).
*   numpy: For efficient numerical ops (e.g., vectorized outlier detection).
*   multiprocessing: Pre-installed; use for parallel ingestion from multiple sources to speed up (e.g., fetch APIs concurrently).
*   logging: Built-in; expand to file+console with levels (DEBUG for details, ERROR for failures).
*   statsmodels: For advanced validation (e.g., ADF test in validate_data.py).
*   Manual Retries: Since no tenacity, implement try-except with exponential backoff using time.sleep.
*   torch: Optional for GPU acceleration if large data (e.g., tensor ops on prices), but not essential for ingestion.

Why Enhanced: Prevents crashes on flaky APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage rate limits), handles GB-scale CSVs without OOM, logs for audits.
Update to requirements.txt (if editable): Add comments for these; no new installs needed.

# Improvements to Testing

The code needs better testing for production: Current simulations are basic; add pytest-based unit/integration tests covering edge cases (e.g., API failures, invalid data, large files). Generate a new file tests/test_data_ingestion.py for Segment 1.1. Tests use real small datasets (subset of EUR/USD). Fit into tests/ dir as per planning doc.
