# FXorcist Integration Plan: Decomposition Tests, EconML, Classification Templates

## Goals
1. Add robustness testing via decomposed likelihood-ratio approximations
2. Add causal inference capability to estimate the effect of events/signals on returns
3. Improve signal classification by adding an ensemble model zoo

## Components Overview

### 1. Decomposition Tests
- Purpose: Validate models under noisy, low-signal conditions
- Implementation: `fxorcist_integration/tests/decomposed_tests.py`
- Key Features:
  - Component-wise classifiers for better likelihood ratio estimates
  - Robust performance under high market noise
  - Support for rare-event scenarios

### 2. Causal Inference (EconML)
- Purpose: Estimate heterogeneous treatment effects from market events
- Implementation: `fxorcist_integration/causal/econml_effects.py`
- Key Features:
  - Treatment effect estimation for economic events
  - Orthogonal machine learning models
  - Confidence intervals for causal impacts

### 3. Enhanced Classification
- Purpose: Improve prediction accuracy through ensemble methods
- Implementation: `fxorcist_integration/models/model_zoo.py`
- Key Features:
  - Random Forests for reduced overfitting
  - Support for multiple classifier types
  - Automated model selection
