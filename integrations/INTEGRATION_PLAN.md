2. Alphalens
   - Analyze signal predictive power (IC)
   - Study signal decay patterns
   - Evaluate factor effectiveness

### C. Production ML & Causal Analysis
1. EconML
   - Estimate causal effects of trading signals
   - Implement trade gating based on causal insights
   - Monitor and update effect estimates

2. MlFinLab
   - Triple-barrier labeling for better signal quality
   - Purged cross-validation to reduce leakage
   - Advanced feature engineering techniques

3. Model Zoo

   - Validate causal assumptions carefully

## Monitoring & Maintenance

1. Regular Tasks
   - Schedule model retraining
   - Update causal effect estimates
   - Generate performance reports

2. Alert Conditions
   - Model drift detection
   - Performance degradation
   - System resource utilization

3. Documentation
