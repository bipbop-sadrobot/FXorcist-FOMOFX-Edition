"""Generate human-readable narrative reports from model explanations.

Transforms technical model explanations into:
- Natural language summaries
- Interactive visualizations
- Actionable insights

Features:
- Automated report generation
- Integration with explainability module
- Plotly visualization support
- Customizable templates

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from utils.narrative_report import NarrativeReportGenerator
    
    # Initialize with model and features
    reporter = NarrativeReportGenerator(model, feature_names)
    
    # Generate full report
    report = reporter.generate_report(X_test)
    
    # Generate instance report
    instance_report = reporter.generate_instance_report(X_test.iloc[[0]])
    ```

Design Decisions:
- Uses SHAP values from explainability module
- Focuses on actionable business insights
- Maintains technical details for analysts
- Visualizations optimized for dashboard use
