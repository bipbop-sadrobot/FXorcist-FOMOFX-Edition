# Memory System Architecture

## Overview
The integrated memory system combines multi-tier memory storage with:
- **Rolling Memory Storage**: Maintains recent prediction records
- **Meta-Model Training**: Learns optimal model selection patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Enables real-time system integration
- **Federated Learning**: Secure distributed model training
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time outlier identification

## Core Components

### 1. SharedMetadata
- Central repository for model/feature metadata
- Tracks:
  - Registered model versions
  - Feature data types
  - System subscribers
- Provides documentation via `generate_documentation()`

### 2. EventBus
- Pub/sub communication system
- Handles events:
  - `new_prediction`: Triggered when models make predictions
  - `model_registered`: When new models are deployed
  - `memory_updated`: When new records are added
  - `anomaly_detected`: For real-time alerting

### 3. IntegratedMemorySystem
- Combines storage and analysis capabilities, utilizing multi-tier memory storage (Short-Term Memory, Working Memory, Long-Term Memory, Episodic Memory, Semantic Memory).
- Key features:
  - Automatic record pruning
  - Meta-model training
  - Trend analysis (`analyze_memory_trends()`)
  - Insight generation (`generate_insights_report()`)
  - Resource prioritization (`prioritize_resources()`)
  - Hybrid vector search + symbolic lookup for memory indexing and retrieval.
  - Memory Operations: store(entry, tier, metadata), recall(query, filters), update(id, changes), forget(id or tier, conditions), summarize(tier, timeframe)

#### Data Structures
- Vector DB (FAISS, Qdrant, Weaviate, or Pinecone).
- Document Store (Postgres/SQLite for metadata).
- Graph Store (Neo4j / NetworkX for relationships).

### 4. FederatedMemory
- Distributed learning system
- Features:
  - Secure model aggregation
  - Weighted averaging
  - HMAC-verified updates
  - Progressive model refinement

### 5. AnomalyDetector
- Real-time monitoring system
- Capabilities:
  - Isolation Forest detection
  - Continuous background scanning
  - Automated alerting
  - Feature-based anomaly scoring

## Usage Example

```python
# System initialization
event_bus = EventBus()
metadata = SharedMetadata()
memory = IntegratedMemorySystem(event_bus, metadata)
federated = FederatedMemory(event_bus, metadata)
detector = AnomalyDetector(memory)

# Full system operation
def run_system_cycle():
    # Process new predictions
    memory.add_record(new_prediction)
    
    # Federated learning round
    federated.train_round()
    
    # Anomaly detection
    anomalies = detector.detect_anomalies()
    if anomalies:
        event_bus.publish('anomaly_detected', anomalies)
```

## Verification Tests
```bash
# Run all memory system tests
pytest tests/test_federated.py tests/test_anomaly.py -v

# Check performance benchmarks
pytest tests/benchmark_memory.py --benchmark-json=benchmark_results.json
```

Testing Guidelines:
- Unit Tests: Memory store/recall correctness, Deduplication & summarization.
- Integration Tests: Query latency under load, Retrieval accuracy benchmarks.
- Edge Cases: Empty queries, conflicting updates, max-capacity behavior.

## Resource Allocation
The system dynamically allocates resources based on:
- Prediction error trends
- Model performance
- Feature importance
- Anomaly frequency

Call `prioritize_resources()` to get current allocation recommendations.
The system uses adaptive memory policies with memory scoring that adapts with reinforcement signals and configurable retention policies per tier.

## Advanced Features
- Context Management: Sliding-window context feed from memory into tasks, Automatic summarization of large memory chunks.
- Knowledge Graph Integration: Build concept graphs from semantic memory, Link entities across conversations and sources.
- Versioned Memories: Snapshot/rollback of memory states for testing, Change tracking for incremental fine-tuning.
- Security & Privacy: Encrypted persistent storage, Redaction filters for PII before storage.

## API Layer
REST + WebSocket endpoints:
POST /memory/store
GET /memory/recall
PATCH /memory/update
DELETE /memory/forget
GET /memory/dashboard

## Deployment Guidance
Containerized (Docker) microservice.
Pluggable backends (swap FAISS → Pinecone).
Configurable persistence strategy (SQLite dev → Postgres prod).
