# Project Scope Alignment Document

(Reference Guide for AI Development & Iteration)

1. Purpose

This document defines the guiding principles, scope, and reference boundaries for the project. It ensures alignment between intended outcomes, AI-driven iterations, and human oversight. It acts as both a north star and a filter for evaluating ideas, features, and trade-offs.

2. Vision Statement

The project aims to build an AI-driven system that:

*   Learns progressively while remaining adaptable.
*   Balances efficiency, accuracy, and usability.
*   Creates measurable value for end-users.
*   Follows ethical and transparent development practices.

3. Guiding Principles

*   Alignment over expansion â€“ Prioritize building correctly over building more.
*   Modular growth â€“ Features should be extensible without over-complication.
*   Human-in-the-loop â€“ AI suggestions must support, not replace, critical human judgment.
*   Iterative refinement â€“ Rapid feedback and controlled experiments guide improvement.
*   Traceability â€“ All design and development decisions should be explainable.

4. In-Scope

*   AI model design and training (core algorithms, reinforcement, and supervised approaches).
*   Feature discovery and prioritization via AI + human collaboration.
*   Data preprocessing, structuring, and validation pipelines.
*   Testing frameworks (unit, integration, scenario-based).
*   Deployment strategies for local and cloud environments.
*   Feedback loops for progressive self-improvement.

5. Out-of-Scope (for Now)

*   Full automation without human oversight.
*   Long-term strategic forecasting beyond current dataset capabilities.
*   Non-core integrations (e.g., external plugins, non-priority APIs).
*   Unverified or speculative features not aligned with immediate goals.

6. Stakeholder Perspectives

*   Technical Experts (AI/ML Engineers): Prioritize model performance, scalability, reproducibility.
*   Domain Experts (Subject-Matter Knowledge): Ensure contextual accuracy and value.
*   End Users: Require clarity, intuitive usability, and minimal friction.
*   Project Managers: Need measurable milestones, risk management, and scope control.
*   Ethics & Compliance Review: Maintain responsible AI use, transparency, and accountability.

7. Success Criteria

*   âœ… AI outputs align with project goals (accuracy, usability, scalability).
*   âœ… Features are delivered iteratively with measurable improvements.
*   âœ… Stakeholder perspectives remain integrated into decision-making.
*   âœ… AI operates within defined boundaries of scope without drifting.
*   âœ… Documentation and traceability maintained for all iterations.

8. Risks & Mitigations

*   Scope creep â†’ Mitigate via alignment checkpoints and reference to this document.
*   Over-engineering â†’ Keep modular, prioritize MVP first.
*   Data quality issues â†’ Implement strict validation pipelines.
*   Bias in AI outputs â†’ Regular audits and explainability checks.
*   Stakeholder misalignment â†’ Maintain open communication channels and review cycles.

9. Next Steps

*   Implement analyze_memory_trends() in core.py.
*   Flesh out generate_insights_report() so it outputs clear text/JSON with key metrics.
*   Write end-to-end integration test: add records â†’ consolidation â†’ anomaly detection â†’ report.
*   Swap TF-IDF for a small local embedding model (sentence-transformers MiniLM runs fine on M1).
*   Add explainability hooks (e.g. SHAP/LIME) for anomalies and trends.
*   Integrate lightweight visualization (Streamlit or Dash).

ðŸ“Œ Living Document:
This scope alignment guide is iterative. It will evolve alongside the project, informed by both AI-driven insights and human feedback.
