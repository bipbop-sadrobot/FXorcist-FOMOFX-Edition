# Forex AI Dashboard Development Roadmap

## Core Objectives
1. Improve model adaptability to changing market conditions
2. Enhance system observability and maintainability
3. Reduce technical debt while accelerating feature development
4. Improve onboarding and architectural documentation

---

## 1. Reinforcement Learning Improvements

### Proposed Implementation
```python
class HierarchicalRL:
    def __init__(self, layers=3):
        self.strategist = GPT4DecisionLayer()  # Top-level strategic direction
        self.tactician = LSTMExecutionLayer()  # Mid-term tactical adjustments
        self.executor = DQNAgent()             # Short-term order execution
        
    def make_decision(self, market_state):
        strategy = self.strategist.analyze(market_state)
        tactics = self.tactician.adapt(strategy, market_state)
        return self.executor.execute(tactics)
```

### Open Questions
- What should be the depth of hierarchy? (Current proposal: 3 layers)
- How to handle communication between hierarchy levels?
- What failure modes should we anticipate in layered decision-making?

### Next Steps
- [ ] Define interface contracts between hierarchy levels
- [ ] Implement event bus for inter-layer communication
- [ ] Create failure recovery protocols

## 2. Model Performance Enhancement

### Key Opportunities
| Technique          | Expected Impact | Difficulty |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Meta-learning      | High            | High       |
| Ensemble stacking  | Medium          | Medium     |
| Dynamic weighting  | High            | Medium     |
| Residual learning  | Medium          | Low        |

### Strategic Questions
1. Should we prioritize CatBoost improvements or transition to transformer architectures?
2. How frequently should we retrain meta-models?
3. What threshold constitutes "model degradation" requiring intervention?

---

## 3. Feature Engineering Pipeline

### Proposed Features
1. **Market Regime Detection**
   ```python
   def detect_regimes(data, volatility_window=20, threshold=0.05):
       returns = data.pct_change().dropna()
       volatility = returns.rolling(volatility_window).std()
       return (volatility > threshold).astype(int)
   ```
2. Economic Calendar Impact Scoring
3. Cross-Asset Correlation Tracking

### Integration Challenges
- Real-time feature calculation latency
- Feature versioning across model versions
- Backward compatibility during rollout

---

## 4. Technical Debt Resolution

### Priority Areas
1. **Test Consolidation**
   - Merge 7 test files into unified `test_predictive_system.py`
   - Create base test class with common fixtures
   
2. **API Standardization**
   - Enforce consistent parameter naming
   - Version all public endpoints
   - Adopt GraphQL for flexible data queries

3. **Build Optimization**
   - Reduce CI pipeline time from 18min â†’ <5min
   - Parallelize test execution
   - Implement incremental builds

---

## 5. Documentation Strategy

### Proposed Documents
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and data flows
2. `DECISION_LOG.md` - Key design choices and rationale
3. `ONBOARDING.md` - Developer environment setup
4. `OPERATIONS.md` - Monitoring and alerting procedures

### Documentation Standards
- All major components require:
  - Purpose statement
  - Interface specification
  - Error handling approach
  - Example usage

---
