# Feature Engineering System Documentation

## Overview

The feature engineering system is designed to provide a robust, maintainable, and version-controlled approach to generating and managing features for the forex trading AI pipeline. The system handles feature dependencies, tracks feature metadata, and provides tools for analyzing feature importance.

## Core Components

### 1. FeatureRegistry

Manages feature versioning and dependencies:
- Stores feature metadata
- Tracks feature versions
- Manages dependency relationships
- Persists registry state to disk
- Provides dependency resolution

### 2. FeatureGenerator

Generates features with built-in safeguards:
- Respects feature dependencies
- Handles missing data
- Provides error recovery
- Updates feature statistics
- Supports incremental updates

## Feature Categories

### Basic Price Features
- `returns`: Log returns of close prices
- `volatility`: Rolling volatility (configurable window)
- `spread`: High-low spread

### Technical Indicators
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - Multiple timeframes supported (e.g., rsi_14, rsi_28)
- Bollinger Bands
  - Upper/lower bands
  - Percentage bandwidth
  - Multiple timeframes

### Volume-Based Features
- `volume_intensity`: Volume weighted by return magnitude
- Volume trends and patterns
- Abnormal volume detection

### Market Microstructure
- Price gaps (up/down)
- Trading intensity
- Volatility clustering

## Feature Metadata

Each feature includes:
```json
{
    "name": "feature_name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Feature description",
    "dependencies": ["list", "of", "dependencies"],
    "parameters": {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2"
    },
    "created_at": "timestamp",
    "updated_at": "timestamp",
    "category": "feature_category",
    "statistics": {
        "mean": 0.0,
        "std": 1.0,
        "skew": 0.0,
        "kurtosis": 3.0,
        "missing_pct": 0.0
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Feature Generation
```python
generator = FeatureGenerator()
df_features = generator.generate_features(df)
```

### 2. Specific Feature Generation
```python
features = ['returns', 'volatility', 'rsi_14']
df_features = generator.generate_features(df, feature_list=features)
```

### 3. Feature Importance Analysis
```python
importance = analyze_feature_importance(
    df_features,
    target_col='returns',
    feature_cols=features,
    method='correlation'
)
```

## Feature Dependencies

Dependencies are managed automatically:
1. Direct dependencies: Features directly required
2. Indirect dependencies: Dependencies of dependencies
3. Circular dependency detection
4. Missing dependency handling

Example dependency chain:
```
returns → volatility → volatility_bands
     ↘ → rsi_14 → rsi_signals
```

## Feature Statistics Monitoring

The system tracks key statistics for each feature:
- Mean and standard deviation
- Skewness and kurtosis
- Missing value percentage
- Update frequency

These statistics help identify:
- Data drift
- Feature stability
- Data quality issues
- Anomalous patterns

## Best Practices

1. Feature Development
   - Document feature logic and assumptions
   - Include unit tests for new features
   - Validate feature quality metrics
   - Check for multicollinearity

2. Version Control
   - Use semantic versioning for features
   - Document breaking changes
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible
   - Archive deprecated features

3. Performance
   - Use chunked processing for large datasets
   - Implement caching for expensive features
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Profile feature generation time

4. Monitoring
   - Track feature statistics over time
   - Monitor feature importance stability
   - Check for data quality issues
   - Validate feature relationships

## Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling:
1. Missing data management
2. Invalid calculation handling
3. Dependency resolution errors
4. Version conflicts
5. Storage/retrieval issues

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
1. Feature selection automation
2. Advanced importance analysis (SHAP, mutual information)
3. Feature store integration
4. Real-time feature generation
5. GPU acceleration for compute-intensive features

## Integration Points

The feature engineering system integrates with:
1. Data ingestion pipeline
2. Validation system
3. Model training pipeline
4. Monitoring dashboard

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Missing dependencies
2. Feature generation errors
3. Performance bottlenecks
4. Version conflicts
5. Data quality issues
